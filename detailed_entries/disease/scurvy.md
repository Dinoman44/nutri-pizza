Scurvy is associated with a deficiency in vitamin C. Historically it was common amongst sailors who did not carry fresh fruits with them, so they lacked vitamin C in their diets when voyaging. Its incidence decreased once sailors began carrying fresh fruits, especially oranges and lemons, on their voyages.

Vitamin C is essential for the bones and gums, so scurvy mostly affects these parts.

#### Symptoms
 * Swelling/bleeding of gums
 * Teeth may fall out(severe cases)
 * Skin bruises easily and red/blue spots form(usually on the shin)
 * Tiredness, weakness, severe joint pain, easily agitated


### How to cure?
Vitamin C supplements are given to the patient, and like with the sailors they are told to eat more citrus fruits(lemons, oranges, tangerines etc.). There are other vegetables that also contain high amounts of vitamin C, but meat products have very little of it.
