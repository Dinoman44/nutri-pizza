Rickets is a condition that is caused by a deficiency in [Vitamin D](/nutrient/vit_d). The lack of this vitamin results in low uptake of Calcium by the body. Since Calcium is required to build bones and teeth, people with rickets often have mishapen and weakened bones("bendy bones"). This is a severe condition that often affects malnourished children, but less severe cases are common in people with a low amount of Vitamin D in their diets.

#### Symptoms
 * Tiredness, reluctance to walk or move
 * Difficulties in movement(person feels disbalanced)
 * A different(waddling) walk; or other movement
 * Visible skeletal deformities(curved bones)

### Related diseases/disorders
The deficiency of [Vitamin D](/nutrient/vit_d) could also cause 2 other problems, Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia. Both of these involve weakening of the bones, but in different ways: in Rickets the bone deformities are visible, but in Osteomalacia or Osteoporosis they are not. Osteoporosis involves the formation of pores and air bubbles in the bones, causing them to loose their tensile strength and making them more prone to fracture - this issue is often present in older people, whose bones naturally weaken with age. Osteomalacia is similar, but is often linked with a deficiency in [Vitamin D](/nutrient/vit_d) rather than the age of a person.

### How to cure?
Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia are especially dangerous since the sufferer has no idea whether or not they have the condition, until a bone breaks or a proper scan is done. Usually, vitamin D supplements are given to the patient to ensure sufficient intake, but there are many foods that can provide vitamin D, such as mushrooms, fish and certain dairy products.
