Iron deficiency anemia is caused specifically due to deficiency of iron. Anemia has many possible causes, so it is not necessary that intake of iron can cure the problem. A blood test can confirm the cause of anemia. The lack of iron makes it difficult for the blood to pick up and transport oxygen, which can cause various problems.

#### Symptoms
 * Tiredness and lack of energy
 * Shortness of breath
 * Heart palpitations
 * Pale skin
 * Difficulty swallowing and a sore tongue (rare)
 * Painful ulcers around the mouth (severe cases)


### How to cure?
The patient is usually given iron tablets, and prescribed a diet rich in leafy vegetables, fortified cereals and dried fruit. Spinach, beetroot, kale and watercress contain large amounts of iron, but for iron deficient people it is recommended to take them along with iron supplements. Orange juice can be consumed for better absorption of iron from tablets.
