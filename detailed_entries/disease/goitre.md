Goitre is a condition that is caused by a deficiency in [Iodine](/nutrient/Iodine), an important mineral that the body requires for a large number of functions. The Thyroid gland, found in the throat, is directly affected by this disease, and it swells up in the throat, creating a large lump.

Goitre can be classes as Class I, II or III based on the amount of swelling. Class I refers to noticeable swelling, and usually signals the onset of Goitre. Classes II and III represent severe cases of Goitre that need intense treatment.

#### Symptoms
 * Swelling in the throat
 * Difficulty in breathing/swallowing
 * A high-pitched sound when you breath out/in
 * A tight feeling in your throat(due to the swollen thyroid pressing on the airways)


### How to cure?
The patient is usually given Iodine supplements in the form of Iodized salt(salt that contains safe-to-eat iodine compounds). Many seafoods(especially Codfish, seaweed and kelp) are rich in Iodine, and dairy products may also contain some Iodine(refer to manufacturing labels for more information).
