Iron is a metallic element that is often found as iron ore in rocks. It is used as a central atom for haemoglobin, a protein in the blood that carries oxygen around the body. Iron is usually taken up by plants as an ion, and then animals can ingest plant material to meet their dietary iron requirements. Being a transition metal insoluble in water, iron is difficult to obtain and a large number of people suffer from iron deficiency, or at least have lower-than-normal iron levels.

#### Quick info
 * Elemental form - Fe (greyish solid at room temperature)
 * Most commonly found bound to oxygen(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
 * Taken up by plants/animals most commonly as ferrous or ferric ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup> or Fe<sup>2+</sup>)

#### How to ingest?
Iron is found in low amounts in shellfish, dried fruit, beans and nuts, and in beetroots. Some fortified breakfast cereals contain iron, as does soy bean flour. The best source of iron is animal liver(cow/chicken/fish) but consumption of liver meat should be avoided during pregnancy.
