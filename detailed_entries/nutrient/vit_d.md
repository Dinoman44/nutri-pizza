Vitamin D is a type of fat-soluble vitamin that is usually synthesised by skin cells of humans. Its role in the body is to help with uptake of Calcium and Magnesium, and lack of vitamin D leads to less of these minerals being taken up by the body, which leads to weakening of the bones.

Vitamin D is usually synthesised in the skin when UV-B light strikes pigments in skin cells. However, darker skin have more melanin, which blocks this light, so darker-skinned people have to stay out in the sun longer to get the right doses of vitamin D; those living in colder climates are often vitamin D deficient, since the sunlight at higher latitudes contains less UV-B, and their dark skin blocks much of it.

The converse is true for lighter-skinned people - they don't need to be out in the sun for long to get the required vitamin D, but have a higher risk of skin cancer or sunburn due to lack of melanin, and those living in warmer climates near the equator are at a much greater risk of skin cancer/sunburn.

#### Quick info
 * Chemical name - cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2)
 * Soluble in fat, not water, so can be stored in the body for long time
 * The vitamin D we ingest or produce in the skin is initially inactive, and needs to be activated to be used

#### How to ingest?
Vitamin D is present in certain types of mushroom and meat(mostly fish), and vitamin D3/D2 supplements are often prescribed to those at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Dairy products such as milk, cheese and curd also provide vitamin D.
