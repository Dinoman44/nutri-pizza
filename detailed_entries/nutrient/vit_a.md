Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that cannot be synthesised by humans and needs to be ingested. It is essential for embryo development and growth, as well as for maintenance of the immune system. Its main function is in the retina of the eyes, where it combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, a light-sensitive pigment that captures light and allows us to see. This pigment can only tell the light levels, not colour, so low vitamin A levels don't affect colour vision. However, it does cause [Night Blindness](/disease/night_blindness) which includes lowered viewing power at night.

#### Quick info
 * It is actually a group of organic compounds(retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and some carotenoids)
 * Soluble in fat, not water, so can be stored in the body for long time
 * Too much vitamin A can accumulate in the body causing blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, but is rare

#### How to ingest?
Vitamin A is present in large quantities in organ meats, especially the liver of various animals, and orange/red coloured fruits and vegetables(carrots, oranges etc.) contain carotenoids which contribute to vitamin A. Many countries require foods to be fortified with vitamin A, and supplements are readily available.
