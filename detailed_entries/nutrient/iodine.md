Iodine is an element that is found in various organic compounds in the human body, mostly in proteins. Its most important function is in the Thyroid, where it is an important part of thyroid hormones that control metabolism, growth and other hormones. A lack of iodine can cause hypothyroidism, which leads to decreased metabolism, lower core body temperature and frequent tiredness, apart from the usual symptoms of goitre. Hypothyroidism is not always associated with a lack of iodine, there are other causes.

#### Quick info
 * Elemental form - I<sub>2</sub> (reddish-black solid at room temperature)
 * Most commonly found as iodide salts such as potassium iodide(KI)
 * Taken up by plants/animals most commonly as iodide ions(I<sup>-</sup>)

#### How to ingest?
Iodine is very common in seafood, including fish, shellfish, and is most commonly found in seaweed and kelp. By extension, since some ice-creams use seaweed as thickening agents, they have a measurable amount of iodine. But eating 5 servings of ice-cream a day for iodine is no excuse, since there is very little iodine actually present, and the negative effects of the sugar and fat far outweigh the benefits of the iodine.
